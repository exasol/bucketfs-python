Bucketfs
--------
Depending on the database configuration, the bucketfs setup can range from straight forward to fairly complex.
This is due to the fact that:

* Each database can have one or more BucketFS services (in the On-Prem database)
* Each BucketFS service is available on all worker cluster of a database
* Each BucketFS service runs on all data nodes of a database
* Each BucketFS service can have one or more Buckets (in the On-Prem database)
* Each Bucket can hold one or more files

The overview bellow tries to illustrate this in a more tangible manner.
For more details on bucketfs, please also have a look in the `bucketfs section`_ of the `database documentation`_.
